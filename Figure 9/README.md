The current folder corresponds to the experimental data in Figure 9 of the paper. 
The folder "SPLA" is used to generate adversarial samples of SPLA. 
The folder "PGD" is used to generate adversarial samples of PGD. 
The folder "MI-FGSM" is used to generate adversarial samples of MI-FGSM.
The code file "model train.py" is used to train the convolutional neural network model with the training set.
The code file "Accuracy of the robustness test set.py" is used to test the recognition accuracy of the trained model on the noisy image test set.
The code file "Accuracy of the original test set.py" is used to test the recognition accuracy of the trained model on the original image test set.
The code file "Robustness test set.py" is used to generate robustness test sets of different levels.
