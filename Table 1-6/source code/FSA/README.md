The current folder contains the source code files corresponding to Table 1 and Table 4 in the paper. This folder includes the FSA white-box attack. There are two subfolders representing targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively.
## Step 1
You need to add the corresponding parameters to the "fsa_mifgsm.py" and "FSA attack Li.py" files in both the targeted and untargeted attack subfolders under each norm constraint. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the instructions in the source code.
## Step 2
You need to run "FSA attack Li.py" to execute the attack and generate adversarial samples.
