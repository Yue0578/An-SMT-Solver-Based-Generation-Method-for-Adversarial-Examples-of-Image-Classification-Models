The current folder contains the source code files corresponding to Table 2 and Table 5 in the paper. This folder includes the EADEN whitebox attack. There are two subfolders representing targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively.
## Step 1
You need to add the corresponding parameters to the "EADEN.py" and "EADEN attack.py" files in both the targeted and untargeted attack subfolders under each norm constraint. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the instructions in the source code.
## Step 2
You need to run "EADEN attack.py" to execute the attack and generate adversarial samples.
