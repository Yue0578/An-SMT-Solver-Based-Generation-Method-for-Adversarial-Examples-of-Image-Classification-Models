The current folder contains the source code files. This folder includes three subfolders, each representing the C&W white-box attack under three different norm constraints. Within each norm constraint, there are two subfolders representing targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively.
## Step 1
You need to add the corresponding parameters to the "CW.py" and "C&W attack.py" files in both the targeted and untargeted attack subfolders under each norm constraint. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the instructions in the source code.
## Step 2
You need to run "C&W attack.py" to execute the attack and generate adversarial samples.
