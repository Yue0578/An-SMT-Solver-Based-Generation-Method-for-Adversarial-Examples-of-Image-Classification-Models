The current folder contains the source code files. This folder includes two subfolders, each representing the AutoAttack white-box attack under two different norm constraints. Within each norm constraint, there are two subfolders representing targeted and untargeted attacks, respectively.
# For targeted attacks
you need to execute the code in the "targeted attack" folder. The execution steps are as follows.
## Step 1
You need to set the hyperparameters for code execution in the "Autoattack.py", "checks.py, " and "other_utils.py" files. The detailed setup methods are specified in each code file.
## Step 2
You need to run "Auto_attack.py" to execute the attack and generate adversarial samples.
# For untargeted attacks
you need to execute the code in the "untargeted attack" folder. The execution steps are as follows.
## Step 1
"Auto_attack.py" is the core attack algorithm. You need to set the corresponding hyperparameters in the remaining code files. Detailed instructions on how to set these parameters are provided within each respective code file.
## Step 2
You need to run "Auto_attack.py" to execute the attack and generate adversarial samples.
